# Track IT 

This project works alongside the [backend repo](https://github.com/okikiola11/track-it) and contains the following requirements:

- The project is a mobile web app
- The database has 2 tables (Measures and Measurements)
- It uses Postgres as a database
- Ruby on Rails was used for the back-end and to create a REST API
- React was used for the front-end and uses redux to store the info across the app
- The project is deployed accessible online
- Implemented 2 nice-to-have requirements: user authentication from the front-end to the server and a panel to create / update / delete things to measure;
